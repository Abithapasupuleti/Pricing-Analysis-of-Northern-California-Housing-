**Problem Statement:** This project aims to scrape comprehensive and up-to-date property listing data, including pricing details, to gain insights into the current state of the housing market in Northern California, specifically focusing on listings by Essex. By collecting and analyzing this data, the goal is to provide an accurate overview of housing trends, pricing patterns, and market dynamics in the region.


**Data:** The data for this project is collected through web scraping techniques, specifically using Selenium to extract real-time property listings from the Essex website. The key attributes scraped include property price, city name, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, and accessibility score. 


**Tools & Libraries:** Python (Scripting), Selenium (Web scraping), CSV File (Data storage), Pandas (Data
exploration and analysis), Seaborn, Matplot lib (Data Visualizations), Scikit learn (ML Models) & Jupyter
Notebook (IDE).


**Methods:** 

*Data Scraping*

Scraped property listing data from the Essex website using Selenium and saved it as a CSV file.

*Data Cleaning*

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.

*Model Implementation*

Applied multiple regression models to predict property prices:
Multiple Linear Regression
Random Forest Regression
Decision Tree Regressor

*Model Evaluation*
